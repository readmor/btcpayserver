I would like to suggest a tool that would make Bitcoin related giveaways on Twitter transparent and cheat-free. 

Example: I will give $11,294 or a Bitcoin to someone random who retweets this in the next 72 hours (must be following me so I can dm you)

Bill Pulte wants to do a cash or bitcoin giveaway. It is going to be random and the sample set will be selected from the people who retweet the tweet.
Can we build a btcpayserver tool that collects the data from this tweet, forms up a sample set and then randomly selects from the pool. 

Another good usecase would be for CashApp -- Cashapp has CashFridays and they somewhat randomly give away bitcoin to its users who mention their cashapp names under the tweet.

This could easily evolve into self hosted lotteries with timelocked bitcoins.
